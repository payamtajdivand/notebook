## Notebook React App

A simple notebook website built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **React**. You can add notes with an optional title, see them in a grid, and delete any note.

### Run locally

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Start the dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Open the printed local URL in your browser (usually `http://localhost:5173`).

### Project structure

- `index.html` – HTML shell that loads the React app.
- `src/main.jsx` – React entry point.
- `src/App.jsx` – Main layout and state for notes.
- `src/components/NoteForm.jsx` – Form to create new notes.
- `src/components/NoteList.jsx` – Grid of existing notes.
- `src/styles.css` – Styling for the whole app.
